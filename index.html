  <blockquote id="ben">"Angel helped me get rid of an old swing set in my backyard. I also had him wall over a quirky 2nd front door and build a non-existent back door with stairs and fencing for my pup. He is very responsive, shows up when he says he will and takes his time to ensure that he is doing quality work. I would recommend him to anyone I know!"<strong>-Ben C., Ogden UT</strong> <a href="#portfolio">See Photos</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote id="jordan">"Angel is one of the hardest working people I know. He is flexible, kind and easy to work with. He really listens to you and even accommodated a few last minute changes for us without hesitation. He was at our home for 4 days, installing a new back door and deck and on the final day we were sad to no longer have his presence in our home. He is a true Jack of all trades, he can do it all. I couldnâ€™t be happier with the work he has done and I highly recommend him."-<strong>Jordan W., Ogden UT</strong> </blockquote>
